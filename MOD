How to make modifications:
(Resources can be found in $XDG_DATA_DIRS/soulanchor)

1. databases
2. audio bible
3. music
4. notes
5. color schemes

 1.a translations

The bibles.db database is based upon:
https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases
The id column is not used.

To REMOVE a translation:

- delete the table, e.g. t_kjv
- remove the kjv row in the bible_version_key table

To ADD a translation:

- add a table with the name t_translation
It should have these columns:
INTEGER b
INTEGER c
INTEGER v
TEXT t

- add a row in the bible_version_key table

Notes:
SoulAnchor expects a valid table name beginning with t_
The abbreviation and version column are used for the combo boxes

I can recommend the excellent DB Browser for SQLite software
https://sqlitebrowser.org/

 1.b 

If you want to add booknames in your language, for the books listwidget, add a column in the number_name table.
Column name should start with lang_

 1.c

I used dictionaries that are also used in the android mybible app
https://mybible.zone

add/remove a dictionary in dictionaries.db:
 add a table, e.g. mydict, with topic and definition text columns
 add a row in the info table
  name = mydict
  description = mydict such and such
  strong = false

Note: the strong = true rows should not be modified, they are used for the bottom part of the info window and are not dynamic


 2. audio bible

If you have mp3's of bible CHAPTERS you can place them in the audio-bible folder. The name of such an mp3 should begin with 2 digits, for the bookname detection. And it should end with the chapter indication, 3 digits, and .mp3. 

E.g.

01 005.mp3
01_005.mp3
01005.mp3
01 Genesis 005.mp3

Now the "play this chapter" right click context menu option can be used (only when one chapter is shown).


 3. music

If you have Biblically inspired mp3's you can place them in the music folder. They will be added to the contemplations menu at program startup. If the filename has a scripture reference then SoulAnchor should jump to the book and chapter. (except Hymns, those are checked for a lyrics file and shown in the info frame)

Psalms: place in the music/psalms folder and start the filename with "psalm" or "Psalm", and a number. E.g. Psalm 1 blessed is the man.mp3

Hymns: place in the music/hymns folder and if there is a .txt file with the same name, it should be displayed in the info frame. E.g. hymns/Come, Thou Long-Expected Jesus.mp3 + Come, Thou Long-Expected Jesus.txt

Other inspired music: can be placed in the music folder. E.g. 1-cor-13-love.mp3

valid scripture links are:
book chapter
book chapter:verse
book chapter:verse-verse

 4. notes

Example note in markdown format:

### Make a note in the notes folder

In plaintext or in _markdown_ format. All .txt and .md files in this directory will be added to the text contemplations menu.

Links can be created like this: 
* Scripture links: 
  - <a href="bible:heb 6:19">Heb. 6:19</a>
  - <a href="bible:ps 1-2">Psalm 1-2</a>
* Strong links: <a href="strongs:G1">G1</a>

 5. color schemes

Can be defined in soulanchor.conf in ~/.config/soulanchor in html color format under:
[Schemes]
name=number color, text color, title color, background 1 color, background 2 color, highlight color
Eg: amber=#775F18, #3E2A11, #b29a00, #fff7bf, #ffee80, #5BF4DA
