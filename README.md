# SoulAnchor - X11 Bible Tool

*this hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and one which enters within the veil*

&nbsp;

SoulAnchor is a basic and free X11 Bible reading tool with some extra's.

The vision i have for SoulAnchor:
* Basic but handy tool for daily use
* Bible reader first, light study tool second
* Avoid distractions, keep it focused
* Open / easy to modify, add/remove translations
* Multiple ways to contemplate the Word, text, audio, image

&nbsp;

### Installation

For Arch Linux you can use the PKGBUILD from the AUR.
Dependencies: qt5-base, qt5-multimedia.

Manually: After running `qmake` and `make`, use `sudo make install`. If you keep the build directory you can later use `sudo make uninstall`.
Note: the default install prefix is `/usr`. This can be changed with `qmake PREFIX=/dir`
Note2: i noticed that `make uninstall` leaves behind some empty directories. Have to look into that...
Note3: you might want to check soulanchor.pro to see if the install directories match your distro's default locations (the .path lines)
