### It is important...

&nbsp;

<a href="bible:"></a>
To know what a word means. Are we talking about Chinese or Europeans? What does it mean to be Chinese?
Are we talking about a race of people? Or a culture? A religion? All of the former?
Does the meaning of the word American change in time? What if a Japanese immigrates to America and then converts to Judaism?
What do we call him? A Jew? 
Does someone who lives a few thousand years later understand what kind of Jew that American Japanese convert really was?

### discussion over the right way of translating
In the last decades there seems to be more discussion about the proper way to translate instead of just putting "Jew" everywhere.
E.g. from wikipedia's Ioudaios page:

>"Ioudaios (Ancient Greek: Ἰουδαῖος; pl. Ἰουδαῖοι Ioudaioi)[n 1][2] is an Ancient Greek ethnonym used in classical and biblical literature which commonly translates to "Jew" or "Judean".[3][4]

>"The choice of translation is the subject of frequent scholarly debate, given its central importance to passages in the Bible (both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament) as well as works of other writers such as Josephus and Philo. Translating it as Jews is seen to imply connotations as to the religious beliefs of the people, whereas translating it as Judeans confines the identity within the geopolitical boundaries of Judea.[5] "

What can the word mean and at what time? What does it imply? Race, religion, geographical origin, cultural similarities... 

>"We are tempted, of course, to translate [Ioudaismos] as "Judaism," but this translation is too narrow, because in this first occurrence of the term, Ioudaismos has not yet be reduced to designation of a religion. It means rather "the aggregate of all those characteristics that makes Judaeans Judaean (or Jews Jewish)." Among these characteristics, to be sure, are practices and beliefs that we would today call "religious," but these practices and beliefs are not the sole content of the term. Thus Ioudaïsmos should be translated not as "Judaism" but as Judaeanness.[10]"

>"Incalculable harm has been caused by simply glossing Ioudaios with ‘Jew,’ for many readers or auditors of Bible translations do not practice the historical judgment necessary to distinguish between circumstances and events of an ancient time and contemporary ethnic-religious-social realities, with the result that anti-Judaism in the modern sense of the term is needlessly fostered through biblical texts.[13]"

I'm not so much concerned with 'the harm' that comes from associating modern Talmudism with ancient Judaism. Jesus was certainly not mild in His statements against the tradition of the elders. Is that tradition so much different in our days? In fact i think it can very well be argued that the strongest link between the present and the past manifestation of this kind of religion and it's followers is the similarity of the doctrines and the commandment of God-Jesus to be aware of this leaven and distance ourselves from it <a href="bible:Mat 16:6-12">Mat 16 6-12</a>.

What does real harm is this, <i>if we put the modern word "Jew" everywhere in the Bible translations, we will have a hard time understanding God's promises to Israel and the redemption He has provided through the cross</i>. He sold Israel for nothing and bought them back without money but by His blood. 
<a href="bible:Isaiah 50:1">Isaiah 50:1</a> <a href="bible:Isaiah 52:3">Isaiah 52:3</a> <a href="bible:Isaiah 53:6-12">Isaiah 53:6-12</a>

&nbsp;

### does it make sense to use the word "Jew" in our Bible translations? 

Often it can be seen in people's statements that they make no distinction between ancient Israelites and later Judeans and modern Jews.
They keep talking about "Gods chosen people, the Jewish people", by which they mean both the modern Jews and even every descendant of Jacob. For them Jew has become a synonym for Israel and the assumption is that those who are called Israel in our time are very similar to those that were called Israel in the past. 

An illustration of this way of thinking can be seen in Charles Buck theological dictionary under his definition of the word Jew. He writes: "Jews, a name derived from the patriarch Judah, and given to the descendants of Abraham by his eldest son Isaac." Such an opening immediately jumps from Abraham-Isaac to Judah (and even the modern Jews by using this word in this context) while ignoring the whole nation of Israel. By doing so he puts the reader in a wrong frame of mind. It now looks as if not all of the descendants of Jacob/Israel are Gods chosen covenant people. Instead the conclusion must be: it's mostly or only about the Jews. Since only they are usually identified as descendants of Jacob. "We shall here present the reader with as comprehensive a view of this singular people as we can. 1. Jews history of the - The Almighty promised Abraham that he would render his seed extremely numerous ..."

Charles Buck goes on to write many things about 'the history of the Jews'. His comments on the Israelites are very meager, a few sentences in which he again reduces Israel to the Jews and redirects the reader to the history of the Jews...

The Bible story of Gods election of a people to form a special relationship with that nation is not about the history of 'the Jews' or Judeans. But it should read the history of Israel, the descendants of Abraham-Isaac-Jacob. The promise was for all the descendants of Israel. Not for one tribe only, and not for converts to Judaism/Talmudism that are not necessarily a descendant of Israel and have nothing to do with this lineage. E.g. those who converted in Babylon because they feared the Judeans <a href="bible:Esther 8:17">Esther 8:17</a>. We could say something good about converting to the true religion of the God of Israel if that is indeed the case and done out of free will. But converting to Judaism has come to mean that one agrees with and comes under the influence of the doctrines of men which are not only useless but also offending to God <a href="bible:Mar 7:1-13">Mar 7:1-13</a>. The oral traditions that were added to the original law make that law powerless as we can learn from Jesus words. The result of this deviation from the original commandments has made the later religion similar in value to all other religions that deny Jesus Christ as God and Savior. They are contrary to the exclusive nature of the revelation of Jesus Christ since there is no other way to the Father but through the Son.
<a href="bible:Joh 14:6-15">Joh 14:6-15</a>
<a href="bible:Joh 5:22-27">Joh 5:22-27</a>

&nbsp;

### for whose benefit? 

Charles Buck is certainly not the only one with this kind of faulty reasoning. It is a pattern that can be discovered in many theological works and heard often from the pulpit. Not in the least because of the efforts of those who are involved in Zionism. Since it obviously benefits them if Christians believe that they are the same as the ancient Israelites and that Christians will be blessed if they bless the Jews which we must see as His people Israel. On the other hand they don't like to hear criticism of their religion/system. It is a double-edged sword, don't look at their deeds (e.g. political and religious) but just keep blessing them with political and financial support. Let us not forget that God's love for historical Israel never meant that they got a license to sin and still receive Gods blessings. On the contrary, God punished the Israelites when they persisted in breaking His law. They were to be blessed or cursed depending on their actions. <a href="bible:Deut 28">Deut 28</a> <a href="bible:Lev 26">Lev 26</a> The further away they got from keeping the law, the more cursed they became. Until Jesus provided a way out by means of the new covenant. Those who obeyed the commandments of Jesus became Christians. It is only through His name that salvation is possible. Their is no salvation in any other way e.g. in claiming an Israel identity or following their religious doctrines that are far removed from the will of God.

&nbsp;

### a weak theology of God destroying most of the nation of Israel

As far as theology goes this "Jew only mindset" is a weak doctrine in which God has done away with most of his covenant people Israel by dissolving them in the many nations that they were sent in through captivity. It is as God through Hosea is lying when making the promise that both kingdoms will become one people again. Or at the very least this must all become true in the future... but we can understand through the Bible itself that it is not future but present.
We can understand through Paul in Romans (E.g. <a href="bible:Rom 11">Rom 11</a>) that God has not forgotten His chosen people Israel. Jesus talks about this other sheep of a different fold in <a href="bible:John 10:16">John 10:16</a> "I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd." Sheep is symbology for the Israelites with God Jesus as the shepherd. E.g. <a href="bible:Mi 2:12">Mi 2:12</a> <a href="bible:Jer 23:1">Jer 23:1</a> <a href="bible:Jer 50:6">Jer 50:6</a> <a href="bible:Eze 34">Eze 34</a> <a href="bible:Ps 44:12-13">Ps 44:12-13</a> <a href="bible:Ps 79:13">Ps 79:13</a> <a href="bible:Ps 95:7">Ps 95:7</a>

Other animals are used for other nations, often not in a neutral or positive manner. E.g. wild animals, wild beasts that harm His sheep.
<a href="bible:Eze 34">Eze 34</a>

Another example: a dog can describe a Canaanite. 
<a href="bible:Mat. 15:24-26">Mat. 15</a>
>"24 But He answered and said, "I was sent only to <u>THE LOST SHEEP OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL</u>. 25 But she came and began to bow down before Him, saying, "Lord, help me! 26 And He answered and said, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."

&nbsp;

### the lost sheep, of the house of Israel

Israel are the children, the sheep. At that time when the division between the two kingdoms was still very relevant they were clearly designated by Jesus as "the lost sheep of the kingdom/house of Israel" contrary to the sheep of the house of Judah. That they were lost meant that God had sold them into captivity and excluded them from the promises of Israel. They broke the covenant and God rejected them. <a href="bible:hos">Hos</a>

However Jesus had, and has, not forgotten the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Even though only the remnant of the house of Judah had preserved their Israel identity. And although most of the Judeans seem to have given up on their kinsmen in the dispersion, God had not. And although most theologians in our time cannot, or will not, identify the descendants of Israel, God has kept His promise and blessed these descendants of Abraham/Isaac/Jacob and made them into many nations. And it is in those nations that the seed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ has found good earth to grow in. History proves that it are mainly these nations/people that represented Christendom. 

<a href="bible:Hosea 1">Hosea 1</a>
>"10 Yet the number of the sons of Israel Will be like the sand of the sea, Which cannot be measured or numbered; And in the place Where it is said to them, "You are not My people," It will be said to them, "You are the sons of the living God." 11 And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel will be gathered together, And they will appoint for themselves one leader, And they will go up from the land, For great will be the day of Jezreel."

Now the other references to tribes of Israel in the new covenant make more sense.
<a href="bible:James 1">James 1</a>
>"1 James, a bond-servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes who are dispersed abroad: Greetings."

<small>
Note: the distinction between the kingdoms cannot be seen as a clean division of all the tribes. Judah had not only those of Judah but also of the other tribes as we can read. And not all of the house of Judah went back to Judea. However it is clear that both Jesus and the disciples are aware of and concerned with: those of the house of Israel in the dispersion, which represented the majority of the Israel tribes in the dispersion. These tribes are also mentioned in The Antiquities of the Jews by Flavius Josephus. <i>"but then the entire body of the people of Israel remained in that country; wherefore there are but two tribes in Asia and Europe subject to the Romans, while the ten tribes are beyond Euphrates till now, and are an immense multitude, and not to be estimated by numbers."</i></small>

&nbsp;

>"1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who reside as aliens, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who are chosen" <a href="bible:1 Petr 1">1 Petr 1</a>

<a href="bible:eph 2:12-22">eph 2:12-22</a>

Israel is still very important as we can read in verse 12. Those who were alienated from the commonwealth of Israel are now part of Israel once more under the new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah <a href="bible:Heb 8:8">Heb 8:8</a>.

The disciples knew about Gods grace for them we can learn from their writings. Even though their culture had often become one of looking down upon 'the heathens' as they had become unworthy in their eyes. You could not even sit down to eat with them. <a href="bible:Gal 2:12">Gal 2:12</a>.
The 'true Israelite' Judeans still had the appearance of Israel, but as we can understand from Jesus words, those religious leaders had not the Spirit of God. Quite the opposite, they had become hypocrites and power hungry. Those who followed them: the blind following the blind. <a href="bible:Mat 15:14">Mat 15:14</a>

The Israelite brothers in the dispersion were not completely forgotten at that time, but rather seen as unworthy. A sentiment probably going back as far as the original division of Israel into two kingdoms, who at times even went to war with each other. They formed their own central places of 'true worship' and of course the 'true believers' sacrificed only in those holy places. What was supposed to be true worship of God became religion that primarily served as support for the political power. To admit that God might also be worshipped in another place outside of their authority went against their interests. As we can read both in the history of the house of Israel and the house of Judah and what does Jesus say in John 4? "

>"
19 The woman said to him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.
20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and you say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
21 Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
22 You worship you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the <i>Judeans</i>.
23 But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.
24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
"

The truth is that both kingdoms had become ungodly. The leaders, the organized religion, the places of worship, corrupt. What matters most to God is if there is truth and love within.

What do those who don't worship the Father in spirit and truth do? The opposite, the keep insisting on central power, so called holy places in a holy land be it in Jerusalem or Rome. And whoever can control such a holy place must be appointed by God they teach, and many follow them. It seems that those with the smallest amount of godliness often display the greatest amount of external 'holiness' in their clothes and speech and rituals and worship. They need those external signs as the proof that they are chosen by God and people should follow them. <a href="bible:Mar 12:38-39">Mar 12:38-39</a>

&nbsp;

### dispersion

<a href="bible:Joh 7">Joh 7</a>
>"35 The Judeans then said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we will not find Him? He is not intending to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks, is He?"

But indeed this is what history proves to us. Those Israelites in the Greek dispersion would be among the main recipients of the good news message of redemption for all of Israel in the new covenant.
<a href="bible: Heb 8">Heb 8</a>
>8 For finding fault with them, He says, "Behold, days are coming, says the Lord, When I will effect a new covenant <u>With the house of Israel and with the house of Judah</u>; 9 Not like the covenant which I made with their fathers On the day when I took them by the hand To lead them out of the land of Egypt; For they did not continue in My covenant, And I did not care for them, says the Lord. 10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel After those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws into their minds, And I will write them on their hearts. And I will be their God, And they shall be My people."

Yes there are promises also for the non Israelite alien/stranger. Those can be seen even in the old covenant. But let us first understand that God has not forgotten His chosen people of both the house of Israel and the house of Judah. Who can be found among the people that have become as numerous as the sand on the seashore and the stars in heaven and have formed many nations.

&nbsp;

### what happened to the house of Judah

Since the house of Judah kept sinning, like the other tribes of Israel in the other kingdom, they were also taken captive and sent to Babylon.
After the Babylonian captivity we can see more of the this rebellion. Their religion went further downhill. Some repented and became known as Christians. Others continued to sin until God destroyed their place in Judea.
Some are called Jews in our time. Others who are called Jews can be traced back to a certain people, the Khazars. Can such Khazars claim that they are the descendants of Judah and claim the promises of Israel? <a href="bible:Rom 9">Rom 9</a>

The Khazars converted to Judaism. Just like certain Edomites (e.g. the Herodians). Can we say that Ezau/Edom is a Judahite? Of course not, but the opposite can be clearly read in the Scriptures, Edom was an enemy of Jacob. Chosen by God to be so from the womb where the twins were already struggling with each other. A fact that remains important if we want to understand the history of Israel and her future. These stories are given for our understanding and are everything but trivial or outdated. God tells us what was and is to come and thousands of years are as mere days for Him.

&nbsp;

### Conclusion

The Word explains it, only TRUE Israel can claim certain promises. <a href="bible:Rom 9-11">Rom 9-11</a> 
They are the children of the promise so willed by God. These are not just the true descendants of Israel but also the sheep that hear His voice and obey His commandments. They believed in Christ and became known as Christians <a href="bible:acts 11:1-26">acts 11:1-26</a>. This history and the biblical explanations, teach us both the importance of the race of Israel and obedience to Gods commandments. Of which the latter is more important. And regardless of bloodline as can be seen in Scriptures like these, were God ignored His own people because of sin.
<a href="bible:luke 4:24-29">Luke 4:24-29</a>
<a href="bible:acts 7:51-54">acts 7:51-54</a>

God created the races and allowed other subraces to come into existence (e.g. Moab). But He also provided a place for many strangers/foreigners to share in the blessings that He first showed to the world through His nation Israel. Israel was also meant to be an example to show righteousness, wisdom and wealth that comes when serving the true God.
<a href="bible:deut 4:1-10">deut 4:1-10</a>
<a href="bible:1 ki 10:1-9">1 ki 10:1-9</a>

Repentance is more important than having Abraham as a forefather. 
<a href="bible:Mat 3">Mat 3</a> 
<a href="bible:Luk 3">Luk 3</a>

It is only that part of Israel that can repent through believe in Jesus that is true Israel. Both in the flesh and in the Spirit.
