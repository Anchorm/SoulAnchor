### It is important...

The word used in the Scriptures is immersion (greek: baptizo - Strongs: <a href="strongs:G907">G907</a>) and not sprinkling (greek: rhantizo - <a href="strongs:G4472">G4472</a>).
 
Why does it matter? Because it's a holy ritual ordained by God and part of His plan for us to follow so we can be forgiven and receive eternal life (e.g. <a href="bible:Mark 16:16">Mark 16:16</a> ).
The importance of this ordinance cannot be understated. Peter when talking about salvation compares the water of the baptism/immersion ritual with the ark of Noah in which a few people were saved <a href="bible:1 Pet 3:20-21">1 Pet 3:20-21</a>.

Let's consider another important instruction at the time of Israel in Egypt (<a href="bible:Exo 12:22">Exo 12:22</a>). What would have happened if those Israelites had found all kinds of reasons not to obey Gods commandment? Would they have lived? 

Or how about Naaman who was instructed to perform a certain ritual in order to be cleansed/healed (<a href="bible:2 Ki 5:10">2 Kings 5:10</a>). He disagreed with the instructions at first. Why...what was hindering him to obey a simple commandment?

Are these not examples given for us so we can better understand that our God requires us to obey His Word? To follow His instructions and not make up our own traditions? E.g. <a href="bible:Mark 7:1-13">Mark 7:1-13</a>. The traditions of men cannot save us no matter how many ritual washings they do.
 
### What is required for salvation?

The immersion ritual is not the only requirement for salvation of course. There are many other instructions given to us e.g. to work out our salvation with fear and trembling <a href="bible:Phil 2:12-13">Phil 2:12-13</a>, <a href="bible:James 2:14-26">James 2:14-26</a>. We can learn from the Scriptures it is both God who chooses and man who must respond to His call by obeying. Through failure and grace there can be growth and more walking without stumbling. This is of course a theological topic of much importance and it would be a mistake to take an extreme position of expecting everything from God or giving man all power to choose. The Word shows us both sides and doesn't ask us to have the wisdom that only God can have e.g. <a href="bible:Rom 9">Rom 9</a>. In the end all that matters is if we strive to obey His commandments e.g. <a href="bible:Ec 12:13-14">Ec 12:13-14</a> with the understanding that we can never do this as perfect as the Master showed us. Much more can be said about this topic, however the goal of this writing is not about all the details that have to do with salvation. But to briefly show why it is important to use the proper biblical word for the new testament instruction of immersion.
  
### Immersion - not sprinkling

Most of the time it's obvious that baptizo is indeed immersion in water. Other times it can be debated if it's more 
like washing with water e.g. <a href="bible:Lu 11:38">Luke 11:38</a>. Perhaps it was partial immersion and pouring and scrubbing using a basin with water for washing the feet and hands e.g. <a href="bible:Exo 30:18-21">Exo 30:18-21</a> <a href="bible:John 13:3-10">John 13:3-10</a>. However that still is not sprinkling. Does sprinkling make sense if one wants to do a proper literal cleaning?

There is a verse (<a href="bible:Acts 16:33">Acts 16:33</a>) that talks about both washing (<a href="strongs:G3068">G3068</a>) wounds and immersing (<a href="strongs:G907">G907</a>). Note that different Greek words are used and the context makes it clear what is meant. At other times (<a href="strongs:G911">G911</a>) it is also clear that it might not be a full immersion, e.g. a finger in water (<a href="bible:Luk 16:24">Luke 16:24</a> or a piece of bread being dipped (<a href="bible:John 13:26">John 13:26</a>).

When talking about baptism for the forgiveness of sins (<a href="bible:Acts 2:38">Acts 2:38</a>, <a href="bible:Acts 22:16">Acts 22:16</a>) God has provided all the context that we need to understand _who_ can be baptized and _why_. And to understand the _mode_ which requires lots of water which only makes sense when immersing.

### Who? The repentant believer.
  
<a href="bible:Mark 16:16">Mark 16:16</a>  
<a href="bible:Acts 2:38">Acts 2:38</a>  
<a href="bible:Acts 8:36-38">Acts 8:36-38</a>

### How?

1. water is required:
  * <a href="bible:Acts 8:36">Acts 8:36</a>

2. how much water?
  * a lot <a href="bible:John 3:23">John 3:23</a>
  * <a href="bible:Mat 3:6 Mat 3:16">Mat. 3:6, 16</a>

### The symbolism agrees

The baptism burial symbolism in <a href="bible:Rom 6">Romans 6</a> makes perfect sense when talking about immersion. 
Sprinkling, not so much. And how about "clothed with Christ"? <a href="bible:Gal 3:27">Gal 3:27</a>
